Acknowledgement 
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Professor Alex 
Bryson, for his consistent support and guidance on this dissertation. I am 
extremely grateful for our inspiring and constructive meetings and your 
encouragement in my very first quantitative research paper writing. 
I would like to thank my family and my boyfriend Yiming Liu, for their constant 
love, support, and encouragement.
I would also like to thank UCL, IOE, and Social Research Institute for offering me 
three years of meaningful and unforgettable undergraduate experience.
